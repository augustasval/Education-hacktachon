    "theory": "Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. The fundamental concept is that we can perform operations on unknown values (variables) just like we do with regular numbers.\n\nUnderstanding Variables:\nVariables are letters (like x, y, a, b) that represent unknown numbers. Think of them as containers that can hold any number. For example, if x = 5, then 2x means 2 × 5 = 10. Variables allow us to write general rules and solve problems where the exact number isn't known yet.\n\nIdentifying Constants:\nConstants are fixed numbers in an expression that don't change. In the expression 3x + 7, the number 7 is a constant while x is a variable. Constants remain the same value throughout a problem, unlike variables which can change or be solved for.\n\nRecognizing Terms:\nTerms are parts of an expression separated by + or - signs. In 4x + 3y - 2, there are three terms: 4x, 3y, and -2. Each term is a separate component that can contain numbers, variables, or both multiplied together.\n\nUnderstanding Coefficients:\nCoefficients are numbers that multiply variables. In 5x, the coefficient is 5. In -3y, the coefficient is -3. If you see just 'x' with no number in front, the coefficient is understood to be 1, so x is the same as 1x.\n\nIdentifying Like Terms:\nLike terms have the same variables raised to the same powers. For example, 2x and 5x are like terms, but 2x and 2x² are not because the exponents differ. You can only combine like terms through addition or subtraction.\n\nCombining Like Terms:\nWhen adding or subtracting like terms, add or subtract their coefficients while keeping the variable part the same. For example, 3x + 2x = (3 + 2)x = 5x. This simplification makes expressions cleaner and easier to work with.\n\nApplying the Distributive Property:\nThe distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. For example, 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12. This property is essential for removing parentheses and simplifying expressions. It works with subtraction too: 2(x - 5) = 2x - 10.\n\nWorking with Exponents:\nWhen multiplying variables, add the exponents: x × x = x¹ × x¹ = x². When dividing, subtract exponents: x⁴ ÷ x² = x⁴⁻² = x². Remember that any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1, so x⁰ = 1.\n\nOrder of Operations:\nAlways follow PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction) when simplifying algebraic expressions. This order ensures everyone gets the same answer. Operations at the same level (like multiplication and division) are performed left to right.\n\nChecking Your Work:\nAfter simplifying, verify that all like terms are combined and that you cannot simplify further. Make sure your final answer has variables in alphabetical order (like 3x + 2y, not 2y + 3x). Substitute a value to double-check your simplification is correct.",
