    "theory": "Linear equations are equations where the highest power of the variable is 1. They represent straight lines when graphed and have the general form ax + b = c. Understanding how to solve linear equations is fundamental to all of algebra.\n\nUnderstanding Linear Equations:\nA linear equation contains variables raised only to the first power (no x², x³, etc.). Examples include 2x + 5 = 11 or 3x - 4 = 2x + 1. The goal is to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. These equations are called 'linear' because they graph as straight lines.\n\nThe Balance Principle:\nAn equation is like a balanced scale where both sides must remain equal. Whatever operation you perform on one side must be performed on the other side to maintain equality. If you add 5 to the left side, you must add 5 to the right side too, keeping the equation balanced.\n\nSimplifying Both Sides:\nBefore solving, simplify each side of the equation separately by combining like terms and using the distributive property. For example, in 2(x + 3) + 4 = 16, first simplify the left side to get 2x + 6 + 4 = 2x + 10. This makes the equation easier to solve.\n\nMoving Variables to One Side:\nIf variables appear on both sides of the equation, move them all to one side (usually the left) by adding or subtracting. For example, in 5x + 3 = 2x + 12, subtract 2x from both sides to get 3x + 3 = 12. This groups all variable terms together.\n\nIsolating the Variable Term:\nMove constant numbers away from the variable term using addition or subtraction to get the variable term alone on one side. If you have 3x + 7 = 22, subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15. Now the variable term is isolated.\n\nSolving for the Variable:\nDivide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to find its value. If you have 3x = 15, divide both sides by 3 to get x = 5. If the coefficient is a fraction like x/2, multiply both sides by 2 instead of dividing.\n\nUnderstanding Inverse Operations:\nAddition and subtraction are inverse operations that undo each other. Multiplication and division are also inverses. Use these to isolate the variable: if something is added, subtract it; if something is multiplied, divide by it; and vice versa.\n\nChecking Your Solution:\nAlways verify your answer by substituting it back into the original equation to make sure both sides equal the same number. This step catches arithmetic errors and confirms your solution is correct. For example, if x = 5, substitute it back: 3(5) + 7 = 22 ✓\n\nDealing with Fractions:\nIf your equation has fractions, multiply every term by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate them and make the equation easier to solve. For example, in x/2 + 3 = 7, multiply everything by 2 to get x + 6 = 14, which is simpler to work with.\n\nSpecial Cases:\nSome equations have no solution, like x + 5 = x + 3, which simplifies to 5 = 3 (impossible). Others have infinite solutions, like 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2), which simplifies to 2x + 4 = 2x + 4 (always true). Recognizing these cases is important.",
